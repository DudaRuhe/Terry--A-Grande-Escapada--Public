### <u>Terry: A grande escapada (Terry: The Great Escape)</u>

#### **Description**

It is a 2.5D platform puzzle game for Windows, whose purpose is to allow the player to take on the role of Terry in his escape from the laboratory, in search of freedom. To do this, you will need to cross the obstacles in your path.
To solve the challenges that will arise throughout the 10 phases that make up the game, the player will create “platforms” with a machine that Terry will find at the beginning of his escape.
There are different types of platforms: speed, impulsion and friction. And the number of platforms that the player can build is limited, however there will always be enough for the player to achieve the objectives!
